ProGENitor is broken into several different groupings of code.  To place a call
to ProGENitor, the user must send a JSON Object containing a query and a query
type.  This JSON Object is then passed to the Database block which will fetch
data from the database based on the user passed JSON Object.  The fetched data
will be passed to a block of Analytics code, which will process the data to
produce a career mapping and then extract the significant information in that
career map.  This data is then returned in a large JSON Object containing multiple JSON
Arrays. See Figure
\ref{fig:HighLevelProjectArchitecture}
for a representation of this sequence.
