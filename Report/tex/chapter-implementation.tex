As outlined in the architecture chapter, ProGENitor is made up of several
different pieces of code.  It contains a database framework to draw data for
analysis.  It has a tool to generate synthetic data for testing.  The core tool
contains code to map out career paths and show important points along the path. 
It also uses Weka to draw some insights about the data that the mapping code
may fail to capture.  ProGENitor would then return the results in a object
such that a user interface could render the information to an end user.
