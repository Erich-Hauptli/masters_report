As outlined in the Chapter 2, ProGENitor is made up of several
different sections.  It contains a database framework to draw data for
analysis.  It has a tool to generate synthetic data for testing.  The core tool
contains algorithms to map out career paths and show important points along the
path.  It also uses Weka to draw some insights about the data that the mapping
algorithms may fail to capture.  ProGENitor would then return the results in a
object such that a user interface could render the information to an end user.
