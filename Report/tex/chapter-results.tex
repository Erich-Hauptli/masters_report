\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}
Upon running ProGENitor, the user will be returned a large object
containing all of the data that is extracted from the database queries.  This
object will contain an object for the career path results and the Weka
results.  Each career path object will also contain three objects.  These
objects contain the graph node ordering data, the graph edge data, and the
details on each node.  Currently, all the data for each node is returned.  In
the future, to improve performance, switching the node data extraction to be
upon request will speed up the overall career path graph results.
