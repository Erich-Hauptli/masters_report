Upon running ProGENitor, the user will be returned a large JSON Object
containing all of the data that is extracted from the database queries.  This
JSON Object will contain an Object for the Career Path Results and the Weka
results.  Each Career Path Object will also contain three objects.  These
objects contain the node ordering data, the node interconnect data, and the
details on each node.  Currently, all the data for each node is returned.  In
the future, to improve performance, switching the node data extraction to be
upon request will speed up the overall career mapping results.
