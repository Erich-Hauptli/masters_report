\section{Project Overview}
\label{sect:project-overview}
ProGENitor is built off of the vision of providing end users with actionable
data to make career decisions through the analysis of vast amounts of career
data.  It does this by consuming data from career databases, processing it using
the algorithms presented within this paper and through an open source tool called
Weka.  The Weka tool set analyzes the data that is passed to it and draws
complex associations between the data using predefined algorithms.  The actual
implementation of the algorithms used by ProGENitor will be demonstrated through
a proof of concept project.  A benchmarking study will be presented to
further analyze the results.  This paper will show that ProGENitor can present a user with a
complete career path graph based off of a simple query.  Additionally, it
will show that the user will be able to dig deeper into the graph to obtain
further insights into which actions within the graph have the most significant
impact to reaching a career goal.  Additionally, using the Weka tool, it will
also be demonstrated that a combination of actions may also be required to
achieve the user targeted career goal.
