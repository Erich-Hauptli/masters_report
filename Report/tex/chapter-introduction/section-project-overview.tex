\section{Project Overview}
\label{sect:project-overview}
The ProGENitor project is a Java based project that draws data from a SQL
database and runs some basic analytics against the data to provide some career
guidance to the end user.  It does this by pulling data from a SQL database by
matching data based on a particular search term passed in by the user.  This
search term can be a particular job or degree or any other available field and
is passed into the project via a JSON Object.  The project then generates a
career path map that others have followed to reach that similar point and
provides some insight into the important points allong that map.  All of the
data is then returned in a JSON Object containing several JSON Arrays.  This
data can then be rendered by any intreface that can decode the JSON Object.  To
test and develop this mock data was generated by a Perl script and loaded into
the SQL database.
