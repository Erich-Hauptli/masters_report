\label{sect:motivation}
Navigating a career can be a difficult endeavor.  Individuals and corporations
not only have to keep up with a daily demands, but they also have to look to the
future to advance, grow, and prepare for unseen demands.  Knowing how to prepare
directly impacts how successful an individual or corporation is in the future. 
Focusing on the wrong preparation and training wastes time, effort, and can
impact motivation.  This costs companies and individuals money, lost time, and
missed opportunities.  ProGENitor was designed to empower users with information
about where they could take their careers and how to actually reach their career
goals.  It does this by processing vast amounts of data from a career database. 
This data is then turned into a career path graph that shows users how to reach
a job and provides insights into the paths that are most likely to achieve the
end goal.  This vast amount of data exists today within social sites such as
LinkedIN, yet seems to not be used to benefit the users in this fashion. 
ProGENitor fills this gap and can be used to assist individuals and companies
in targeting efforts towards the most effective actions to achieving a career
goal or advancement.
