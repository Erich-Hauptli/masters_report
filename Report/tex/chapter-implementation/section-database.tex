\section{Database}
\label{sect:database}
As ProGENitor needed a method to pull large amounts of data off the backend
server database, a Java method needed had to be implemented that inferfaced with
the database.  MySQL was chosen as it is open source, widely used, and fairly
easy to learn quickly.  Once the MySQL interface was established a wrapper was
added such that another database method could be inserted without a significant
work effort in the rest of the code.  Then, through this wrapper, the many
different function calls wer implemented to collect the data needed to generate
the career map and derive any further insights through Weka.

\subsection{MySQL Interface}
To greatly simplify this work, a predefined library jar was added
to to the project.  In this case, the library used was SQLite JDBC.  The SQLite
library allows for easy access to a MySQL database for creating, reading from,
writting to, and querrying the database.  In the case of ProGENitor, once the
library was added, the code was very straight forward.  Through a couple
commands, the code established the database connection, ran the specified query
or other command, and collected the returned data.\cite{sqlite}  Using the
SQLite library allowed the MySQL interface to quickly add in functions to create
a database, collect query matches from the database, upload lines and files to
the database, modify lines within the database, and even pull the entire
databse.  With these functions in place, ProGENitor quick easily and quickly
access any defined database.  In the case of ProGENitor, four databases were
generated; one for user profile data, one for education data, one for job data,
and finally one that contains the headers of the other databases.  If, in the
future, additional databases are needed, ProGENitor can easily add them. 
Additionaly, as the SQL commands are standard commands, the interface can easily
be be replaced with another database interface or expanded upon by anyone
familiar with a SQL language.

\subsection{User Wrapper}
As previously stated, it was desired that ProGENitor be setup such that it was
easy to swap out the database interface with another interface.  Thus, the user
interface wrapper was written to call the various SQL commands.  If in the
future, the database needed to be changed, the work to do so would reside in
adding the database interface and changing the user interface wrapper to point
to the new database.  The wrapper also adds in commands that make interfacing
with the code a bit more straight forward.  Commands such as add user, database
setup, query matching users, and return headers all allow users working through
other portions of code to understand what the function calls are actually doing
and do not require the developer to necessarily understand the database
interface commands.  Then using these commands, ProGENitor can then collect
datat that it passes along to be interpreted by the connections and instights
packages.
