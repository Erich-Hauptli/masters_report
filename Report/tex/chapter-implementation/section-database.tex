Section Description.  

\subsection{MySQL Interface}
As ProGENitor needed a method to pull large amounts of data off the backend
server database, a Java method needed had to be implemented that inferfaced with
the database.  To greatly simplify this work, a predefined library jar was added
to to the project.  In this case, the library used was SQLite JDBC.  The SQLite
library allows for easy access to a MySQL database for creating, reading from,
writting to, and querrying the database.
\\
In the case of ProGENitor, once the library was added, the code was very
straight forward.  Through a couple commands, the code established the database
connection, ran the specified query or other command, and collected the returned
data.\cite{sqlite}  Using the SQLite library allowed the MySQL interface to
quickly add in functions to create a database, collect query matches from the
database, upload lines and files to the database, modify lines within the
database, and even pull the entire databse.  With these functions in place,
ProGENitor quick easily and quickly access any defined database.  Additionaly,
as the SQL commands are standard commands, the interface could easily be
be replaced with another database interface or expanded upon by anyone familiar
with an SQL language.
