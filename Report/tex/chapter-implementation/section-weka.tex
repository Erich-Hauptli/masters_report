Section Description.  

\subsection{Arff Creation}
Weka uses the .arrf file format to feed data into the weka toolset.  The Arrf
file contains two major sections.  These sections are the header section and the
data section.\cite{arrf}  The header contains the name of the relation, a list
of attributes, and their types.  The data section, contains the data that will
be used for machine learning.  A sample .arff file would look like the
following:

@relation education

@attribute degree {PHD,Bachelors,Masters}
@attribute specialization {Electrical,Circuits,Analog,ComputerArchitecture,Digital}
@attribute goal {true,false}

@data
Bachelors,Electrical,false
Masters,Circuits,false
Bachelors,Electrical,false
