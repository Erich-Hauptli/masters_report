Section Description.  

\subsection{Arff Creation}
Weka uses the .arrf file format to feed data into the weka toolset.  The Arrf
file contains two major sections.  These sections are the header section and the
data section.\cite{arrf}  The header contains the name of the relation, a list
of attributes, and their types.  The data section, contains the data that will
be used for machine learning.  A sample .arff file would look like the
following:
\\*
\\*
@relation education\\*
\\*
@attribute degree {PHD,Bachelors,Masters}\\*
@attribute
specialization{Electrical,Circuits,Analog,ComputerArchitecture,Digital}\\*
@attribute goal {true,false}\\*
\\*
@data\\*
Bachelors,Electrical,false\\*
Masters,Circuits,false\\*
Bachelors,Electrical,true\\*
Masters,Circuits,true\\*
PHD,MSU,Digital,true\\*

ProGENitor currently generates the .arff file containing just the educational
nodes.  One of the keys to getting quality insights out of Weka is controlling
the data being fed into the tools.  Thus, in this case only the educational data
is fed into the tool.  This process could easily be replicated for additional
insights.  To generate the arff file, ProGENitor contains a Java method called
generate arff in the connections package.  This code follows the procedure
detailed in figure \ref{fig:arrf generation} to generate the arff file that is
later used by Weka.
