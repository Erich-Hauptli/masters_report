\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:conclusions}
ProGENitor could easily be deployed both in a large scale social environment or
in a business setting.  In both cases, users would benefit from data and
insights that could help them get the appropriate education and experience to
achieve their goals.  This would also help businesses grow their employees
towards needed jobs and improve employee satisfaction, by ensuring the employees
grow and move into their desired position.  This will reduce costs from
employee turn over and unnecessary training.  Additionally, it may also help
employers gain insight into what skills their own jobs require.  In the larger
scale social environment, it encourages individuals to increase the data they
enter into the tools, which allows for the social networks to better target
advertising.  Additionally, this would be another feature that would draw new
users in.  ProGENitor is an analytics tool that is both advantageous to the
end users and the companies that deploy it, which should be a win for both
sides.
