\section{Future Work}
\label{sect:future-work}
Although ProGENitor is already to a point that it could be deployed relatively
quickly, there is still a lot of work that could be done in the future.  One
thing that would be important would be to test and validate the software with
several different database types such as a NoSQL database.  Another area to
focus on would be performance.  There are some areas of the code that could be
parallelized and the database pulls could also be optimized.  As for the actual
data pulled, additional insight could be gathered by generating additional .arff
files to be fed into Weka.  Currently, the code only looks at the education data
for Weka; this could be expanded to also look at the job data or other aspects
of the user data.  Additionally, the user data could be grown to include
information beyond education and employment.  The profiles could be grown to
include data about personality, work style, publications, or any other number of
useful pieces of information.  Finally, focusing on security and robustness by
adding in some testing would also be valuable for a deployable product.  Again,
ProGENitor could likely be deployed now with some minimal effort, but to deploy
a quality well performing product additional work would be needed.
