\section{Summary}
\label{sect:summary}
ProGENitor is a Java based tool that integrates well with web applications.  It
pulls data from databases to generate insights into an individual's careers
based on those who have reached a desired goal.  The tool can generate a career
map to achieving a goal and provide insights about what next steps to
reaching that goal are best.  Using this tool can help an individual focus their
career efforts and see the most efficient path is to reaching their target
position.  With some minor work, ProGENitor could be deployed now, but some
additional improvements would greatly benefit the end users.
