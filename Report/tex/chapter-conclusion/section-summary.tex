\section{Summary}
\label{sect:summary}
ProGENitor delivers upon the initial vision of this project by consuming large
data sets to produce a career path graph that shows a user how other users
have reached the queried goal.  Additionally, it shows the user specific relevant actions
that could be taken to reach that goal in the most efficient manner possible.  As
shown through this paper, the tool can take a very complex data set and
provide quick insights into an individual's career aspirations and provide
actionable next steps through detailed node, graph, and Weka analysis to help
the user reach their goals.  Using this tool can help an individual focus their
career efforts and see the most efficient path to reaching their target.
