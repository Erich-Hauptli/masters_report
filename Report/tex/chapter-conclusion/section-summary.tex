\section{Summary}
\label{sect:summary}
ProGENitor is a Java based tool that integrates well with web applications.  It
pulls data from databases to generate insights into individuals careers based on
those who have reached a desired goal.  As shown in this paper, the tool can
generate both a career map to achieving a goal, provide insights about the best
steps to achieving the goal, and give the user ideas about what to do next. 
Using this tool can help an individual focus their career efforts and help them
see what steps they should take next.  ProGENitor is completed to a point that
it could be deployed now with some minor work, but some additional work would
benefit the end users a lot.
