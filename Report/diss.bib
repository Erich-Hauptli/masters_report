abstract={In recent years, embedded memories are the fastest growing segment of system on chip. They therefore have a major impact on the overall Defect per Million (DPM). Further, the shrinking technologies and processes introduce new defects that cause previously unknown faults; such faults have to be understood and modeled in order to design appropriate test techniques that can reduce the DPM level. This paper discusses a new memory fault class, namely dynamic faults, based on industrial test results; it defines the concept of dynamic faults based on the fault primitive concept. It further shows the importance of dynamic faults for the new memory technologies and introduces a systematic way for modeling them. It concludes that current and future SRAM products need to consider testability for dynamic faults or leave substantial DPM on the table, and sets a direction for further research.},

abstract={Testing static random access memories (SRAMs) for all possible failures is not feasible and one must restrict the class of faults to be considered. This restricted class is called a fault model. A fault model for SRAMs based on physical spot defects, which are modeled as local disturbances in the layout of the SRAM, is presented. Two linear test algorithms that cover 100% of the faults under the fault model are proposed. A general solution is given for testing word-oriented SRAMs. The practical validity of the fault model and the two test algorithms are verified by a large number of actual wafer tests and device failure analyses},
